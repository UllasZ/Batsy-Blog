Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th 
issue of the comic book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Comics" target="_blank">Detective Comics</a> on March 30, 1939. <br>
In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe" target="_blank">DC Universe</a> continuity, 
Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist 
who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against 
criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, a vendetta tempered with
the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and
monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with 
supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and 
Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.

Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the
murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman 
persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal
residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off 
his family's fortune and the profits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" target="_blank">Wayne Enterprises</a>, his inherited conglomerate. He supports 
philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues 
encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. 
In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. 
Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.
